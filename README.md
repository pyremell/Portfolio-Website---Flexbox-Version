# Portfolio-Website---Flexbox-Version
WIP of Portfolio Website
This is my prototype portfolio website. It was hand-made with CSS and HTML, and the images of the planets were drawn by me with 
Illustrator. The star background was acquired from NASA's royalty free images archive. The site is a WIP, and I will be uploading it to my domain as soon as I'm satisfied with it.
